# Simple CIA login using Python and Flask

---
## Explanation of CIA
### Confidentiality
This is the system in which to keep data secure from accidental and intentional access. This heavily depends on secure and accurate authorization and authentication.
### Integrity
This is the system in which it keeps the data authentic, accurate, and reliable. This also depends on secure and accurate authorization and authentication.
### Availability
This is the system in which it keeps the data available and gives a timely delivery of data. Without availability the data is useless.

## Usage in My Demo
The demo keeps data confidential my limiting availability to certain pages depending on the roles given to the currently logged in user. If we were to extend disbelief there would be password hashing and form management or some other kind of AuthN. 
The demo does not touch on integrity in any meaningful way as there is no data being entered or edited.

## App Logic Explanation
This is an app that allows access to certain pages depending on roles given to users' accounts.
